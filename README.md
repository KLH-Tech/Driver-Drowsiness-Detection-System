# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-System

In this project, we aim to develop a driver drowsiness detection system that helps people by detecting drowsiness while driving the vehicle and it automatically alerts the person so that he can drive safely.

The focus will be on developing a framework that can continuously monitor whether the driver's eyes are open or closed. 
A robust real- time system to monitor the loss of attention of the driver during day and night driving conditions.
